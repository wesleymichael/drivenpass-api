## Routes and Functionalities

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Health (`/health`)

- Route solely for ensuring the application is up and running.
- **GET** `/health`: Returns the message `"I am okay!"` with the status code `200 OK`.

### üë§ Users (`/users`)

- The application allows users to create accounts and use them to access other functionalities.

   #### Account Creation
   
   - Users must provide a valid email and password to create an account.
   - If the email is already in use, the application will not allow the account creation (`409 Conflict`).
   - Passwords must meet security criteria, including at least 10 characters, 1 number, 1 lowercase letter, 1 uppercase letter, and 1 special character (`400 Bad Request`).
   - Passwords are stored securely in the database using the [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) library.
   
   #### Account Access
   
   - Users must use the registered email and password to access their accounts.
   - If incompatible data is provided, the application will respond with `401 Unauthorized`.
   - After a successful login, users will receive a JWT token for future authentication.
   - **This token must be sent in all requests to identify the user.**

### üîë Credentials (`/credentials`)

- Credentials refer to login information for websites and services.

   #### Credential Creation
   
   - To register a new credential, the user must provide a URL, a username, and a password.
   - The user must also provide a title/name/label for the credential since it is possible to register multiple credentials for the same site.
   - If none of the data is sent, the application will respond with `400 Bad Request`.
   - Each credential must have a unique title/name/label. Attempts to create two credentials with the same name will be prevented (`409 Conflict`).
   - Credential passwords are encrypted in the database using an application secret, with the use of the [cryptr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cryptr) library.
   
   #### Credential Retrieval
   
   - The application allows users to retrieve all credentials on the `/credentials` route or a specific credential using its ID on the `/credentials/{id}` route.
   - If a user tries to access a credential that does not belong to them, the application will respond with `403 Forbidden`.
   - If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
   - If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
   - All returned credentials appear with the password decrypted (`200 OK`).
   
   #### Delete Credentials
   
   - The application allows the deletion of credentials based on their ID.
   - If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
   - If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
   - If the credential belongs to another user, the response will be `403 Forbidden`.
   
### ‚úèÔ∏è Secure Notes (`/notes`)

- Secure Notes are text-based information.
   
   #### Secure Note Creation
   
   - To register a new secure note, the user must provide a title/name/label and the content of the note.
   - If none of the data is sent, the application will respond with `400 Bad Request`.
   - Each note must have a unique title. Attempts to create two notes with the same name will be prevented (`409 Conflict`).
   
   #### Secure Note Retrieval
   
   - The application allows users to retrieve all secure notes on the `/notes` route or a specific secure note using its ID on the `/notes/{id}` route.
   - If a user tries to access a note that does not belong to them, the application will respond with `403 Forbidden`.
   - If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
   - If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
   
   #### Delete Secure Notes
   
   - The application allows the deletion of secure notes based on their ID.
   - If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
   - If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
   - If the note belongs to another user, the response will be `403 Forbidden`.

### üí≥ Cards (`/cards`)

- Cards represent credit and/or debit cards.
   
   #### Card Creation
   
   - To register a new card, the user must provide the card number, printed name, security code, expiration date, password, whether it is virtual, and its type (credit, debit, or both).
   - If none of the data is sent, the application will respond with `400 Bad Request`.
   - Each card must have a unique title/name/label. Attempts to create two cards with the same name will be prevented (`409 Conflict`).
   - The card's security code and password are encrypted using an application secret, with the use of the [cryptr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cryptr) library.
   
   #### Card Retrieval
   
   - The application allows users to retrieve all their cards on the `/cards` route or a specific card using its ID on the `/cards/{id}` route.
   - If a user tries to access a card that does not belong to them, the application will respond with `403 Forbidden`.
   - If the card does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
   
   #### Delete Cards
   
   - The application allows the deletion of cards based on their ID.
   - If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
   - If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
   - If the card belongs to another user, the response will be `403 Forbidden`.

### üì∂ Wi-Fi (`/wifi`)

- Wi-Fi entries represent access data for an internet network.

   #### Wi-Fi Creation
   
   - To register a new Wi-Fi entry, the user must provide the network name, network password, and a title to differentiate each data entry.
   - Since it is sensitive information, the internet network password must be encrypted using an application secret, with the use of the [cryptr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cryptr) library.
   
   #### Wi-Fi Retrieval
   
   - The application allows users to retrieve all Wi-Fi entries on the `/wifi` route or a specific Wi-Fi entry using its ID on the `/wifi/{id}` route.
   - If a user tries to access a Wi-Fi entry that does not belong to them or does not exist, the application will respond with `403 Forbidden` or `404 Not Found`, respectively.
   
   #### Wi-Fi Deletion
   
   - The application allows the deletion of Wi-Fi entries based on their ID.
   - If an invalid ID is sent, the response will be `400 Bad Request`.
   - If the ID does not exist, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
   - If the Wi-Fi entry belongs to another user, the response will be `403 Forbidden`.

### üóëÔ∏è Delete Account and All User Data (`/erase`)

- The route allows the user to delete their account and all associated data.
- When this action occurs, credential, note, card, and other data are deleted from the database, along with the user's registration.
- Since it is a destructive action, the password must be sent again in the request body for the action to be executed. If the password is incorrect, the response will be `401 Unauthorized`.
